Hello! My name is Nathan, a 26 year old Linux kernel hacker, currently working as an independent contractor for [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).

I help [maintain](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b9644289657748314dbfe6502c316b3f09e251ed) [ClangBuiltLinux](https://clangbuiltlinux.github.io), resulting in [a few hundred patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=author&q=Nathan+Chancellor) to the Linux kernel and [a few patches](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits/main?author=nathanchance) to LLVM. I have contributed to ClangBuiltLinux's [continuous integration](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/continuous-integration2) and wrote most of the [booting utility scripts](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/boot-utils) and [toolchain build scripts](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/tc-build).

I am a [Senior Recognized Developer](https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/nathanchance.6842057/) on XDA, where I started my development journey as a custom kernel developer for the Nexus 6P, Pixel 1 (XL), Pixel 2 (XL), OnePlus 5, and OnePlus 6. I maintained [android-linux-stable](https://github.com/android-linux-stable) from November 2017 to January 2021, which was used by many kernel developers within the Android community.

[My resume](https://nathanchance.dev/nc_resume.pdf) is always available on [my website](https://nathanchance.dev/), where there are also links to all of my social media accounts. I maintain [a blog](https://nathanchance.dev/posts/) where I occasionally share things that I have found interesting. Feel free to reach out to me there or via email if you have any questions about my work!
